The only value I can see for the port of embarkation is to determine where most of the passengers boarded which could give an indication which port is larger and possibly give an idea where each passenger lived.\n",

    "* Name: Unique identifier\n",
    "* Age: Used to determine average age of passengers and the age rangers for deceased and surviving passengers\n",
    "* Passenger Class: Used to determine the number of deceased and surviving passengers from each socio econonmic status\n",
